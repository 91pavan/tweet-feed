Happy tweeting

For our application ,we use the twitter API to get the tweets of the Username whichever is entered in the textbox . 


We have other features as well which basically lets the user see how many retweets that particular tweet has got , the date and time associated with the creation of the tweet .
Further , clicking on the tweet will open a MessageBox which will show the description of the twitter username , number of followers and number of tweets till date .
